=========Tuples=======================
In Python, a tuple is an immutable collection of elements, 
similar to a list. However, unlike lists, tuples cannot be modified after they are created. 
Tuples are defined using parentheses () and can contain elements of different types.

Tuple Methods
Python has two built-in methods that you can use on tuples.

Method	Description
count()	Returns the number of times a specified value occurs in a tuple
index()	Searches the tuple for a specified value and returns the position of where it was found
