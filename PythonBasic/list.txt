Python Collections (Arrays)
There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:

* List is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Tuple is a collection which is ordered and unchangeable. Allows duplicate members.
* Set is a collection which is unordered, unchangeable*, and unindexed. No duplicate members.
* Dictionary is a collection which is ordered** and changeable. No duplicate members.

======LIST==========================
In Python, a list is a collection of items enclosed in square brackets [].
Lists can contain elements of different data types, including integers, strings, floats, and even other lists (nested lists). 
Lists are mutable, which means you can change the elements in a list after it has been created.
